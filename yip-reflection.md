What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
- I always have trouble remembering the difference between git push and git pull and understanding how to differentiate between origin and remote folders. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- Git pull was clarified for me. Understanding that all the changes you and your team made is needed to be pulled back to your local repo. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- I asked whether the driver was able to look through the instructions as well? 

What still confuses you about Git?
- I still dont understand why we need to indicate origin before the branch or what else could be said besides origin? 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
- It was wonderful! Our guide was really nice and jumped in whenever we were struggling. Definitely helped my learning and understanding of Git!
