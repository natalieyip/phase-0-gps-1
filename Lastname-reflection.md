What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Just the overall workflow and some of the commands for the terminal. 
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Just making pull requests and also merge conflictss. 
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked both the pair and guide for clarification on some concepts especiallly related to markdwon syntax and style. 
What still confuses you about Git? I think I still need more practice with the git commands but nothing conceptually confuses me. 
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? It was awesome and a really supportive environment! The guide was really helpful in clarifying any parts or processes that were unclear and my partner was also really helpful in looking up other details.
